# Jupyter Notebooks using Financial Toolkit

Jupyter is a browser-based interface that allows users to interact with Python scripts in an interactive environment.

In this repository, I have developed several Jupyter notebooks that showcase common use cases in investment management, leveraging the Financial Toolkit.

No Python? No problem. With Binder, you can run and interact with these notebooks in a fully executable environment. No Python installation required on your computer.
