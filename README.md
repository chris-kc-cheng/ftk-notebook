# Jupyter Notebooks using Financial Toolkit

Jupyter is browser-based shell that allows user to interact with Python scripts.

In this repository, I have developed some Jupyter notebooks showing the most common use cases in investment management that utilizes the Financial Toolkit.

No Python? No problem. With Binder, you may interact with the Jupyter notebooks in an executable environment even without Python installed in your computer.
